# SOP: Argumentative Research Workshop (Unit 2)

**Scope:** Unit 2 Argumentative Research (Essay 2)
**Timeline:** Wednesday (Async Feedback) $\rightarrow$ Friday (Sync Workshop)
**Feedback Framework:** A.R.C. (Arguable, Rational, Cohesive)

## 1. The A.R.C. Feedback Framework
All feedback must utilize the following criteria. Do not focus on grammar; focus on the argument's structure.

| Criteria | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Arguable** | Does the paper make a claim that could be debated? (Not just a statement of fact). |
| **Rational** | Is the reasoning supported by evidence (Primary & Secondary sources)? |
| **Cohesive** | Do transitions and structure carry the reader logically from point to point? |

## 2. Phase 1: Asynchronous Feedback (Wednesday)
**Location:** Remote / Canvas Discussion Board
**Goal:** Prepare written analysis for three peers.

### Step A: Analyze Peer Drafts
1.  **Access:** Open the essays sent to you by your peer group.
2.  **First Pass (Skim):** Read once for structure.
3.  **Second Pass (Comment):** Write 3–4 brief comments per draft focusing on:
    * **ARC:** Is it Arguable, Rational, and Cohesive?
    * **Voice:** What feels human vs. stilted?
    * **Methods:** How is primary research described?
    * **Synthesis:** How are scholarly vs. mainstream sources used?

### Step B: The "Revision Plan"
Create a Google Doc titled **"A2 Revision Plan – Draft"** containing:
* A 2–3 sentence summary of your own argument.
* One feedback point you intend to address.
* Three specific actions to strengthen arguability or cohesion.

## 4. Deliverable: Peer Letter #2
**Due:** Wednesday (Before Class)

    * *Requirement:* Explain *why* the passage is effective or confusing based on the ARC framework.
3.  **Closing Recommendations:** One specific strength and one "revision move" (e.g., reorganizing sections).
