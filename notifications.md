# Configuring Critical Alerts

**Goal:** Ensure you never miss a revision opportunity or workshop deadline.
**Requirement:** You must enable "Immediate" notifications for the items below to satisfy the communication clause of the grading contract.

## 1. Accessing Your Notification Settings
1.  Log in to Canvas.
2.  In the global navigation menu (far left), click **Account** → **Notifications**.
3.  Locate the column labeled **"Email Address"** (or Push Notification if using the mobile app).

## 2. Required Alert Settings
You must set the frequency to **Notify Immediately** (Green Bell Icon) for these specific triggers:

| Alert Name | Why it Matters | Setting |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Announcement** | I post weekly labor logs and deadline adjustments here. | ✅ Immediate |
| **Submission Comment** | When I or a peer leaves feedback on your draft, you need to see it to begin revision. | ✅ Immediate |
| **Conversation Message** | Used for direct 1:1 check-ins regarding your contract status. | ✅ Immediate |

> **Tech Tip:** If you have the Canvas Student App installed, enabling **Push Notifications** is often faster than email.

## 3. Troubleshooting "Missing" Emails
If you are not receiving alerts:
1.  Check your **Junk/Spam** folder for emails from `notifications@instructure.com`.
2.  Verify that your default email in Canvas is your active university address (`@udel.edu`), not a personal Gmail.
