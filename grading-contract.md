# Technical Reference: The Labor-Based Grading Contract

**Model:** Adapted from *Labor-Based Grading Contracts* (Asao Inoue).
**Philosophy:** Grades are determined by the completion of labor targets rather than subjective quality assessments. To earn an **A**, students must meet "A-range" targets across all domains.

## 1. Labor & Assignment Protocols

### Labor Logs
All assignments require a labor log to track engagement. You must document three specific data points for every work session:
1.  **Location:** Where the work occurred.
2.  **Task:** Specific action completed.
3.  **Proficiency:** Self-assessment of focus/quality.

### Assignment Adherence Targets
To maintain A-range status on individual assignments:

| Grade Tier | Hours Logged | Prompt Adherence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A-Range** | 100% of minimum req. | Adheres to **every** item listed on the prompt. |
| **B-Range** | 95% of minimum req. | Adheres to the **vast majority** of items. |
| **C-Range** | 85% of minimum req. | Misses **essential** items (genre/formatting). |

## 2. Participation & Community Targets

Active membership is quantified by your contribution to the peer feedback cycle and preparation.

| Grade Tier | Preparation | Peer Letters Sent | Communication Style |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A-Range** | Completes **all** prep tasks. | **5** Peers | Anticipatory & Professional |
| **B-Range** | Misses 1–2 tasks. | **3** Peers | Occasional difficulty |
| **C-Range** | Misses >2 tasks. | **1** Peer | Pattern of difficulty |

## 3. Attendance & Lateness Policy

**Definition:** Presence is signified by completing the daily **Freewrite** at the start of class.
**Forgiveness:** You are allowed **one (1)** forgiven absence per semester.

### Absence Thresholds

| Grade Tier | Total Absences (Excused + Unexcused) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **A-Range** | ≤ 1 Absence |
| **B-Range** | ≤ 2 Absences |
| **C-Range** | ≤ 4 Absences |

> **Critical Warning:** If you exceed **five (5) unexcused absences**, your final course grade will be automatically reduced by **25%**.

### The Absence Exemption Protocol
To convert an unexcused absence to "Excused" without medical documentation, you must:
1.  **Email** the instructor (`curtisca@udel.edu`) *prior* to the start of class.
2.  **Submit** an additional Response Paper.
3.  **Meet** with the instructor to discuss missed content.

## 4. Deadlines & Extensions

### The 24-Hour Extension Rule
You may be granted an extension **without providing a reason** if you complete the **Extension Request Form** at least **24 hours prior** to the deadline.

### Late Work Penalties
If no extension is on file, the following point caps apply:

| Status | Definition | Max Possible Score |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Late** | Submitted within 48 hours of deadline. | **75%** |
| **Missed** | Submitted *after* 48 hours. | **25%** |
| **Ignored** | Unaccounted for at semester end. | **0%** |
